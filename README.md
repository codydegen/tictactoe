# Tic-Tac-Toe
Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game to practice object-oriented programming, based on The Odin Project curriculum [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript?ref=lnav).

Current build found [here](https://codydegen.github.io/tictactoe/).

# Features

The game allows for head-to-head play between two humans, for one human play against the computer, or for two computers to square off. The computer has two difficulties: easy (the computer makes a random move) or hard (the computer makes the optimal move). The user may also click the "board analysis" button to see the best and worst possible moves.

N.B., there is currently a compatibility issue with Firefox.  For best results, use Chrome.
